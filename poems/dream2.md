Come to me where we're real<br/>
Come touch me where we feel<br/>
The clock ticks forever here<br/>
Its pointers care not if you're near<br/>
<br/>
The streets here are limitless too<br/>
Plenty of places for us two<br/>
I can caress you here much more<br/>
So much more than before<br/>
<br/>
Move away<br/>
Away from whom herds sheep<br/>
Creep delicately onto my bed<br/>
To where you endlessly have me weep<br/>
And mislead me no more in my sleep.<br/>

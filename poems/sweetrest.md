I like my bed<br/>
It always comforted me<br/>
Never done me wrong<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy its softness<br/>
So I stay on it<br/>
It's better than the<br/>
Harshness of reality<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy with its dreams<br/>
They provide me worlds<br/>
Where I am not judged<br/>
Nor am I imprisoned<br/>
<br/>
I like to lay here<br/>
And when I'm gone<br/>
â€”It will be in this bed.<br/>

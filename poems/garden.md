This delightful garden of mine<br/>
surrounds me a charming coloration,<br/>
a scenery to me of noble design,<br/>
forever grants me this observation.<br/>
<br/>
Upon me shine these blooms,<br/>
dahlias, courageously prismatic,<br/>
heathers, my heart's perfumes,<br/>
thistles, compel me ecstatic.<br/>
<br/>
Yet upon me they too are sorrow,<br/>
in dahlias lie your bravery,<br/>
heathers, the scent they borrow<br/>
thistles, long gone our savory.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, a garden I adore,<br/>
one for you I've grown for.<br/>

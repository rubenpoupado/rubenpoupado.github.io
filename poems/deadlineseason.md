Another deadline season comes;<br/>
another season for me to fret;<br/>
My heart once more succumbs<br/>
despite it not being Fall yet.<br/>
<br/>
I hate this kind of feel<br/>
but I love it as well,<br/>
it makes my head squeal<br/>
but it makes my heart compel.<br/>
<br/>
I hate these nights uneasy<br/>
but love these nights teary,<br/>
they make me feel queasy<br/>
but of feeling I'm not weary.<br/>
<br/>
It's bigger than that Fall<br/>
where numbness in me dyed,<br/>
bigger than that thrall<br/>
where the heart in me died.<br/>
<br/>
I love this season;<br/>
I love these days;<br/>
where I break to treason<br/>
with my heart ablaze.<br/>

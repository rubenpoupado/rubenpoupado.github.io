I had a marvelous dream last night,<br/>
a dream where everything was right,<br/>
I laid in bed and I was not alone;<br/>
laid there with her, the one you've known,<br/>
we stared at one another and we smiled,<br/>
as I stared lower I saw her with child—<br/>
It all felt very real and I too could feel<br/>
with a ring on my finger there was no one to steal,<br/>
the future I held dear, the one with you here<br/>
it was all true once more, a life of no drear—<br/>
How I long to live in that dream,<br/>
in my head lies such internal scream,<br/>
how I long to kiss your luscious lips<br/>
and to look at your heavenly hips.<br/>
Instead I wake to this nightmare everyday,<br/>
this nightmare where you didn't stay.<br/>

Hatred, a heavy feeling for a man I resent, he who does not commit; make no sacrifice nor open his rhythmic door.<br/>
<br/>
A broken record taps once more, sharing meaningless talk to himself for everyone and no one to see, about the emprisionment of his speech, his mind, his heart, slave to everybody and nobody.<br/>
<br/>
This hate grows harsher as I observe this man, this corpse, continue playing with his disease, that is not real, an illness of his existence.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I feel thankful of such resilience in his struggles, only so can I remain, to judge him once more.<br/>

In this chat lies tranquility,<br/>
with peaceful discussions on Torn<br/>
and its elegant civility<br/>
lies this old norm<br/>
<br/>
Within it Cartis, the artist<br/>
paints chat so vividly<br/>
of his nudes we harvest<br/>
so timidly<br/>
<br/>
But in comes disturbance<br/>
a trickster of bad fame<br/>
one of much perturbance<br/>
Lost-Soul is his name<br/>
<br/>
Now this chat breathes stupidity,<br/>
with raging discussions on pizza<br/>
and its pineapple validity<br/>
lies this new Srebrenica<br/>

What if I tried something new?<br/>
A writing of marvelous fiction and not you?<br/>
No mind to slavery, no feels to strew,<br/>
only that and no eyes to tear through.<br/>
<br/>
A story of mystery and horror,<br/>
the protagonist one valiant explorer,<br/>
chasing a shadow before her.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I already know,<br/>
in my story you will flow,<br/>
in her shadow you will grow,<br/>
and my heart you will tow.<br/>

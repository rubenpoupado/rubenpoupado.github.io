In my desk at night I sit, alone and distressed I whimper<br/>
"My heart is but split!, hence I cannot simper.<br/>
This half, poised to new beginnings for its left unfulfilled,<br/>
but the other, fearful for the past whom hurt instilled."<br/>
<br/>
The radiant moon shines atrociously bright,<br/>
as atrocious as the shadow of tonight,<br/>
the one who nests my head,<br/>
and swiftly poisons me dread.<br/>
<br/>
Frozen in this night I remain,<br/>
devoid of cure and motion,<br/>
with my hands left to sprain,<br/>
I write to you in devotion.<br/>

It is hopeless, is it not?<br/>
In all my effort and time<br/>
I remain impaired, in a trot<br/>
with this thing I forever mime<br/>
<br/>
Despite my many stories in life<br/>
It is This I relent, my one strife;<br/>
This same old Thing that sticks<br/>
From all Things, This — has no fix;<br/>
<br/>
For years I swim in this commotion<br/>
It is rather humorous — my devotion;<br/>
This love to which I punish me for<br/>
This one I do, more and more;<br/>
<br/>
These have not been distinctive;<br/>
These have all been predictive;<br/>
It may be so this is merely me<br/>
A repetitive being of high degree<br/>
<br/>
So I shall take this defeat<br/>
Once more I shall repeat<br/>
this thing who in me grew<br/>
—This thing of you.<br/>

Numb all that I feel<br/>
As no hurt will heal<br/>
Drown me in mead<br/>
So I will be freed.<br/>
<br/>
No anger, no tears<br/>
A world of no fears<br/>
My vision all coloured<br/>
From the tall glass covered.<br/>
<br/>
Take me back home<br/>
Within pink walls to roam<br/>
With innocence and pride<br/>
Lives young me, inside.<br/>
<br/>
Exciting skills to grow<br/>
For my parents to show<br/>
Whereof life was gentle<br/>
Whereas I, happy, not mental.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah!" — yet in my drowsiness you still remain!<br/>
No mistaking, a resemblance like no other,<br/>
The long-haired shadow is what I see —<br/>
"Bartender, pour me another,<br/>
From her I must flee!"<br/>

The irritating loud static—<br/>
Can you not hear it too?<br/>
This noise so sporadic<br/>
goes with me like the flu.<br/>
<br/>
Worried colleagues are talking—<br/>
Can you not hear them either?<br/>
This noise that is stalking<br/>
is one ear reaper.<br/>
<br/>
The covering grayscale around—<br/>
Can you see it as well?<br/>
This monotony so profound<br/>
where I reside as one cell.<br/>
<br/>
Soon it will all be alright<br/>
as from these I now depart—<br/>
Gray leaves my weakened sight<br/>
and static goes my heart.<br/>

The board had been complete,<br/>
against life I had mate in two,<br/>
but my opponent so discreet,<br/>
my elegant queen it withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
I'm lost since your flee,<br/>
unable to take my turn,<br/>
this could be my debris,<br/>
one to my life's discern.<br/>
<br/>
My board's hues now none,<br/>
every piece feels the same,<br/>
with its mate in one<br/>
lies my crown in frame.<br/>
<br/>
Without you I take this step,<br/>
from this board forever swept.<br/>

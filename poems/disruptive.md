Tonight I sit by my desktop<br/>
sipping my gin tonic nonstop<br/>
with my distant pals present,<br/>
this night may be pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
On this night much debonair,<br/>
plenty activities in the air,<br/>
many surprises, many giggles,<br/>
and here am I, in my riddles.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how drunk and dark,<br/>
I remain forever marked,<br/>
on my wall, you cast your shadow,<br/>
and my heart grows sallow.<br/>

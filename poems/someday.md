I no longer recall your hair,<br/>
as long smooth black silk rare.<br/>
I no longer recall your eyes,<br/>
captivating dark brown skies.<br/>
<br/>
I do not remember your lips,<br/>
refined glossy blush grips.<br/>
I do not remember your accent,<br/>
kindly soft angelic ascent.<br/>
<br/>
I've forgotten the nights of our calls,<br/>
can no longer see your flowery walls.<br/>
I've forgotten the name of your town,<br/>
Kilmarnock, no longer to be around.<br/>
<br/>
No longer do I care about your friend<br/>
nor when you first walked in his house<br/>
as you both gossiped on your sex suspend,<br/>
not even his drugs gave me any doubts.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't noticed you cut your hair short,<br/>
nor did I notice the nose ring you escort.<br/>
Alas, even your wedding ring I did miss,<br/>
nickel-free, to your allergy's dismiss.<br/>
<br/>
I do not mind the surname you now bear,<br/>
nor the betrayal behind my back.<br/>
I do not mind the hurt of your affair,<br/>
nor my life's alternative track.<br/>
<br/>
Someday, I won't recall any of it<br/>
and you won't matter at all.<br/>

Three thousand kilometers away and even now you remain,<br/>
I can't rest on my pillow, it reminds me of our reign,<br/>
you're in my dreams when I sleep and in my thoughts when I wake,<br/>
I can't face my reflection for its smile is fake.<br/>
Why am I like this when you no longer should retain?<br/>
<br/>
The days are bright as your smile, you were always around,<br/>
between classes we'd text and in photos we'd drown,<br/>
now my clock ticks but its time is meaningless,<br/>
I won't ever forget the day of you leaving us.<br/>
<br/>
The nights reek of your scent, you would always call,<br/>
you would show me your face and my heart would stall,<br/>
now I'm lonely and in the darkness I cry,<br/>
I won't ever forget the night of your lie.<br/>

It's been many Falls ago,<br/>
  &emsp;Where we met on screens,<br/>
You and I smiled upon each other<br/>
  &emsp;sharing mundane routines,<br/>
No day would pass by without us<br/>
  &emsp;foolishly sharing cuisines<br/>
Foolish fool me<br/>
  &emsp;in my pitiful teens.<br/>
<br/>
I loved you,<br/>
  &emsp;Thought we matched a pair<br/>
But in routines I turned blind,<br/>
  &emsp;Grown blissfully unaware<br/>
As you kept me in your pocket<br/>
  &emsp;and relished in your affair.<br/>
<br/>
It's been many Falls ago,<br/>
  &emsp;Since the night of hurt,<br/>
The night he raised in blindness<br/>
  &emsp;and my world he subvert,<br/>
No day passes by me<br/>
  &emsp;where I wish I had not flirt.<br/>
<br/>
More so I linger unanswered:<br/>
  &emsp;"Where did I do wrong?";<br/>
Today I still hurt:<br/>
  &emsp;"Was I no one all along?";<br/>
With piles of emotions strong<br/>
  &emsp;This mask I still prolong,<br/>
Perhaps in this I belong.<br/>
<br/>
Yet how can I when I'd felt it,<br/>
  &emsp;Felt the warmth of your soul,<br/>
As you blinked your bewitching skies,<br/>
  &emsp;My hole had turned whole.<br/>
<br/>
How many more Falls since then<br/>
  &emsp;will I remain impaired?<br/>
With a thought erratic so wrong<br/>
  &emsp;since the Fall you dared,<br/>
No longer do I know myself,<br/>
  &emsp;an end to routines shared,<br/>
No longer can I think or write<br/>
  &emsp;since He aired,<br/>
Who is this foolish one?<br/>
  &emsp;Babbling despaired.<br/>
——Loved and lost as this script<br/>
  &emsp;of love and loss.<br/>

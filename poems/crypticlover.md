White as you've been—<br/>
made a new friend under new skin<br/>
with one whom I've not been<br/>
nor would I ever have seen.<br/>
<br/>
Blue as you've been—<br/>
stabbed heartless with your sin<br/>
by one whom I've not been<br/>
nor would I ever have seen.<br/>
<br/>
Black, as fool's disguise—<br/>
ally of the two to my despise,<br/>
darkened my eyes in between<br/>
for whom I'd never seen.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in this dark, I now see—<br/>
for there is other White to be,<br/>
the one who'll set me free,<br/>
away from whom I now have seen.<br/>

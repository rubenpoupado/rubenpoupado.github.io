Am I the only one who doesn't understand humans?<br/>
What is so special about their activities?<br/>
Traveling, festivals, friendly meetups.<br/>
None of these I understand, the excitement they rile up,<br/>
they plan out days with a happy face of one golden retriever.<br/>
<br/>
Since my childhood, I have never had an interest in any of it,<br/>
not to learn an instrument, not to go out with friends.<br/>
What is it that I should care so much about these?<br/>
What is the point of watching time waste by in these meetups?<br/>
What is so exciting about plants and grass in a park?<br/>
<br/>
Yet, that works for other humans.<br/>
In every single person lies plenty of activities for them to enjoy.<br/>
Where are mine? Where are the little details that wake me?<br/>
<br/>
I despise this, how come I don't share these same interests?<br/>
Why are they a waste of energy and time? No values in sight.<br/>
As I've grown all I've learned is my disinterest too has grown.<br/>
<br/>
The moments I genuinely enjoyed drawing, where have they gone?<br/>
Why is it I don't draw? No income? No exposure?<br/>
I'm unhappy with my reasoning, one of no thought to my feelings,<br/>
one of a machine's, calculating the goods of each thing, soulless.<br/>
<br/>
Then you came in, you who made me so conscious about this.<br/>
You who made me write if just about you and for no one to see.<br/>

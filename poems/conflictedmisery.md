This feeling won't go away,<br/>
this soul will not change,<br/>
my heart's been led astray<br/>
and my head gone strange.<br/>
<br/>
Though I'm opposed to drugs,<br/>
I'm addicted to your hugs,<br/>
while it is all in thought,<br/>
your warmth's brought.<br/>
<br/>
Alone and from this world exile,<br/>
only you could make me smile,<br/>
such was when you were near,<br/>
now you're never here.<br/>
<br/>
You, is what I seemingly scream,<br/>
but the reader unknown of your scheme,<br/>
It is not the invidual I miss<br/>
but the pre-betrayal that was bliss.<br/>
<br/>
Our mutual feeling of trust<br/>
that was all so robust,<br/>
all gone since for him you've lust,<br/>
and I â€” you've let rust.<br/>
<br/>
Our mutual feeling of solace<br/>
that was all so flawless,<br/>
now broken to no repair;<br/>
All gone since your affair.<br/>
<br/>
Help me! For many Falls have passed<br/>
and I remain stuck living in that blast,<br/>
this heart of mine, still deep in this abyss<br/>
where I relive all these emotions I miss.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, how do I stop this past one I mourn?<br/>
The one for which my heart has sworn.<br/>
How do I feel for another?<br/>
When she taught me to feel for no other.<br/>

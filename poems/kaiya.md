The flood is seen no more<br/>
Away forever as you swore<br/>
No drenched night in sight<br/>
As you've found the light<br/>
<br/>
No more flood to drown<br/>
Not one dawn to frown<br/>
But a smile you flaunt<br/>
Towards its miserable jaunt<br/>
<br/>
Now crystal clear foundation<br/>
You fight your situation<br/>
Against this vile nation<br/>
Who dislikes your generation<br/>
<br/>
Fret not â€” keep the troubles at bay<br/>
Rise your head high everyday<br/>
For this society we shall own<br/>
Just you know you're not alone.<br/>

Without a beat in my chest, my days go by so carelessly,<br/>
no smile for gossip, no concern for close 'friends'.<br/>
Within this void of a soul, I live so monotonously,<br/>
always in my own mind, always on autopilot.<br/>
<br/>
Why live by this mind of ours, restrained by such poisonous vessel?<br/>
A life of intellectual misguidance, one so well thought yet so close-minded.<br/>
<br/>
I need freedom, but courage lies deep in that poison I detest,<br/>
so I lie here in wait, for time to do its bidding.<br/>

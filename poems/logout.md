I dislike people<br/>
I dislike showing my skin<br/>
Hiding expressions within<br/>
So I don't see people<br/>
<br/>
I meet people in a screen<br/>
There I don't show my hurt<br/>
Easier for truth to divert<br/>
So I'm not seen as a machine<br/>
<br/>
Though I've grown tired<br/>
Tired of chatting dim<br/>
But it's hard to be Him<br/>
With its heart hardwired<br/>
<br/>
So I need none of it<br/>
No mask with emotion<br/>
No fingers in motion.<br/>

Why are you so unfair?<br/>
You, who made me despair<br/>
Whereas I was but a spare<br/>
Left speechless after your scare<br/>
Broken hearted with your affair<br/>
Where in bed you laid bare--<br/>
There, laid a new pair<br/>
One could not compare<br/>
My emotional flare<br/>
In rage I had tear<br/>
My own only chair<br/>
That truth I could not bear<br/>
With my heart beyond repair<br/>
The new pair I had my glare<br/>
Came with a plan so rare<br/>
To accept that fresh air<br/>
Yet pain was in its ware<br/>
Danger laid upon my hair<br/>
As I loved without a care<br/>
Came to reason in my fare<br/>
Of this plan - so impair<br/>
In my numbness I left from there<br/>
Against danger I now beware<br/>
Now, I must prepare<br/>
New beginnings I must dare<br/>
For my freedom to declare.<br/>
